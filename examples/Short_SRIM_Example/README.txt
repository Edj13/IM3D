This is a SRIM example test case, which is designed to test the new IM3D code.

It consists of a five layer structure of 316 stainless steel, molten potassium nitrate, pure titanium, molten potassium nitrate, and 316 stainless steel.

We run a 1D calculation to see the energy deposition and vacancy creation rate in each layer of material, where we change the ion beam energy and see what changes.

The input file is TRIM.IN. Just put this in the same directory as SRIM/TRIM, and run the code to generate the plots of vacancies and energy deposition.
