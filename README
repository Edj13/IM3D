IM3D is a 3d Monte Carlo simulation code designed to run efficiently
on parallel computers. It can rapidly simulate the transport of ions
and subsequent radiation damages in arbitrary complex 3D nanostructured
materials. It is an open-source code, distributed freely under the
terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

IM3D was sponsored by Prof. Ju Li and Prof. Zhi Zeng, and mainly developed
by Dr. Yonggang Li during his visiting to MIT in 2014. The supporting of
CSG/FETM geometric algorithms form Prof. Zejun Ding as well as useful
contributions and discussions from Prof. Machal Short and Dr. Yang Yang
are very appreciate.  Please visit the webiite at xxx.xxx.xxx for more
information about the code and its uses.
